Small toy shell, written in Rust (1.3).

This is a rewrite of some of my OS homework in Rust, so I could get a
feel for the language. It's very nice (_much_ nicer than the C we were
required to turn in).

The requirements for the homework are at
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/teaching/w4118/homeworks/hmwk1.html. I
didn't reproduce everything exactly, but it's pretty close.
