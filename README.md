Some random mini-projects that are large enough for me to keep, but not
large enough for their separate repositories.

In reverse chronological order:

- `calorie-school-reproduction` (2016-07-10) -- A reproduction of a
  result I found in high school.
- `college-gender-ratio` (2016-05-17) -- Some quick plots of the gender
  ratio for different college campuses. Mostly to get my feet wet with
  the [Bokeh plotting library](https://bokeh.pydata.org).
- `python-autodiff` (2015-11-27) -- Forward and reverse mode automatic
  differentiation implemented in Python in Rust. See my [blog post](http://www.columbia.edu/~ahd2125/post/2015/12/5/)
- `rust-autodiff` (2015-11-25) -- Simple automatic differentiation
  implemented in Rust. See my [blog post](http://www.columbia.edu/~ahd2125/post/2015/12/5/)
- `rust-hashmap` (2015-10-12) -- a small hashmap implemented in Rust.
- `rust-shell` (2015-09-24) -- a small shell implemented in Rust.
- `chess` (2015-06-08) -- a Jupyter notebook for my [blog post on
  permutation tests](http://www.columbia.edu/~ahd2125/post/2015/6/8/).
