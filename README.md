Some random mini-projects that are large enough for me to keep, but not
large enough for their separate repositories.

In reverse chronological order:

- `rust-autodiff` (2015-11-25) -- Simple automatic differentiation implemented
  in Rust
- `rust-hashmap` (2015-10-12) -- a small hashmap implemented in Rust.
- `rust-shell` (2015-09-24) -- a small shell implemented in Rust.
- `chess` (2015-06-08) -- a Jupyter notebook for my [blog post on
  permutation tests](http://www.columbia.edu/~ahd2125/post/2015/6/8/).
